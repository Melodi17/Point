## What is Point?
Point is a HTML preproccessor aimed at providing rich features and easier syntax, it adds varibles, scripting support, expression evaluation, comments, importing, file attaching, syntax suggestion, versatile syntax and much more! Point syntax is similar to CSS's syntax and is capable of seamlessly intergrating into your existing web framework or being used standalone. The transpiler is written in C# and is flexible, lightweight and efficent.

## Why use Point?
As we advance into the future, we need more powerful tools to perform more complex tasks, even faster than before. Point is fast, simple and capable. For example, you can now use variables in your code, you can calculate expressions at runtime like this: `1037 * 5`, you would have to open calculator and figure that out if you were using HTML, now you can just write that and it will be calculated for you. Let's say you wanted to make a div with a class spacer, in HTML it would be something like this: `<div class='spacer'></div>`, in Point you can just write: `.spacer { }` as it automatically assumes any element without a tag is a div.
